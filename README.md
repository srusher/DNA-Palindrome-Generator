# DNA Palindrome Generator

## What does this Program do?:
This console application is designed to take in a DNA sequence in string format from the user and create the fewest possible insertions into the original DNA sequence to create palindrome (or a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards). See below for a couple example outputs:
